## Getting the text from wikipedia
The text was not copied and pasted into a text file. Using urllib.request from python 3.9.2 I downloaded the contents of the webpage. By using the inspector in the Firefox browser I found in which tags the content of the file was stored. I opened the file with the Unicode-8 encoding. Using regelar expressions also coming from python 3.9.2, I cleaned the HTML file by first removing all HTML that was not part of the content, removing comments and tables, and all HTML tags. Because regular expression work by line, I removed all newline characters and replaced them with "qqqqq" and at the end placed the newline characters back again. This does mean that when "qqqqq" will become part of the original HTML, which is very unlikely, this python script won't provide a correct text file.
